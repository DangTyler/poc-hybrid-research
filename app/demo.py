Our query `MATCH (g:Grant)-[:ELIGIBLE_FOR]->(s:State {name: 'AL'})` is not just checking a property; it is **traversing a connection** in the graph.
        
        This is a simple example, but it represents a fundamentally different capability. It unlocks the ability to ask questions like, "Find grants from organizations that have previously funded projects that are connected to the topic of 'Education'," which requires traversing multiple relationship hops and is impossible with a metadata filter. **Act 4 is a perfect example of this unique power.**
